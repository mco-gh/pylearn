I'm often asked to recommend a book to help students get started learning Python. There are many good ones, but depending on your style of learning, I have two specific recommendations.

Jake VanderPlas' <a target="_blank" href="https://mco.fyi/pytour">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a> provides a quick guided tour of essential things you should know in order to get started using Python, in less than 100 pages. The price is right too: it's free.

For those who prefer a more comprehensive, tutorial style, I highly recommend Al Sweigart's <a target="_blank" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Edition</a>. This book is very practical and full of fun and interesting examples of real world problem solving with Python. It's also available to read online for free.
